## Core Premise

The Fall '11 pledge class was a historic pledge class;
this pledge class holds the record for the lowest percentage
of boners for a single pledge class in Pi chapter history. A close second
was that pledge class with Tyler Ballay and Ricky Nicolay. The pledge
class with the highest percentange of boners in Pi chapter history was
of course Fall '10.

The Tantamount Classic is a weekend golf tournament held to celebrate
the historic Fall '11 pledge class on a recurring basis. To start, the
tournament will be held every two years.

## Weekend

For any given year, the tournament will be held on the first Saturday
of October.

## Location

The location of the inaugural tournament will be held in Bloomington, IN;
and the location of each tournament afterwards will be determined by
the winner of the previous tournament.

When selecting the location of an upcoming tournament, the winner
of the previous tournament
must choose a location somewhere within the continguous United States.

## Buy-in

In order to qualify for the tournament in a given year, an eligible
player must pay $150 to the executive committee
before the start of the tournament.
The money will be used to host a public list of the winners from
previous tournaments, to pay the winner of the upcoming
tournament, and to otherwise fund the tournament.

## Prize

The winner of the tournament will receive a Pillar of Success trophy
and all of the buy-in money not used to fund the tournament.

## Eligible Players

All initiated Fall '11 members are eligible for the tournament unless
barred by the executive committee. Friends who are not members of
Fall '11 can be eligible to play if approved by the executive committee.

## Executive Committee

The executive committee will consist of 3 members from the Fall '11
pledge class.

Once decided, the executive committee will be listed [here](/pages/committee).

## Core Premise

The Fall '11 pledge class was a historic pledge class in Pi chapter
history; a pledge class rivaled only by that of the pledge class with
Nicolay and Ballay.
The Tantamount Classic is a weekend golf tournament held to celebrate
the great Fall '11 pledge class on a recurring basis.
The frequency at which the tournament
will be held is still up for debate but will likely be in the realm of
every 2 or 3 years.

## Weekend

For any given year, the tournament will be held on the third Saturday
of September.

## Location

The location of the inaugural tournament will be held in Bloomington, IN;
and the location of each tournament afterwards will be determined by
the winner of the previous tournament.

When selecting the location of an upcoming tournament, the winner
of the previous tournament
must choose a location somewhere within the contiguous United States.

## Buy-in

In order to qualify for the tournament in a given year, an eligible
player must pay $150 to the executive committee
before the start of the tournament.
The money will be used to host a public list of the winners from
previous tournaments, to pay the winner of the upcoming
tournament, and to otherwise fund the tournament.

## Prize

The winner of the tournament will receive a Pillar of Success trophy
and all of the buy-in money not used to fund the tournament.
The winner will also get to select the location of the next tournament.

## Eligible Players

All initiated Fall '11 members are eligible for the tournament unless
barred by the executive committee. Friends who are not members of
Fall '11 can be eligible to play if approved by the executive committee.

## Other Activities

On Saturday night we'll do a group dinner and hit the bars afterward.
The winner from the previous tournament gets to select either the
dinner spot or one of the bars for the night.

On Sunday morning many, but likely not everyone, will still be in town
and can plan to do brunch.

## Executive Committee

The executive committee will consist of 3 members from the Fall '11
pledge class.

Once decided, the executive committee will be listed [here](/pages/committee).

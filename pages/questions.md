## Open Questions

* How often should we meet up when first starting?
    Every other year, every three years?
    If this tradition continues far into the future, we'll likely
    want to increase the frequency once we're retired or empty nesters;
    but what about when we're first starting?
* What's the best date for this event to occur on a regular basis?
* The overall goal is to get as many people from our pledge class to
    meet up on a regular basis. Is golf the best way to do that
    if there are members of our pledge class who don't golf or don't
    golf competitively?
* How should the winner be determined? Should handicap be a factor?

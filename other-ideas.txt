The player with the lowest score should get the Pillar of Success trophy
each year. Previous winners should have a handicap or hurdle to winning
money in future tournaments; the handicap or hurdle should have a half
life. A winner should be ineligible to determine the location of the
next tournament until X (maybe 6?) others have had a chance to determine
a location.

There should be a ceremony after the tournament, and the executive team
should wear initiation robes.
